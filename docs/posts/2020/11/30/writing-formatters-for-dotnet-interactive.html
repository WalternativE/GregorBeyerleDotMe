<h2><a name="interactive-programming">Interactive Programming</a></h2>
<p>Many programming languages offer interactive environments, that allow you write your code in little fast paced experiments. Iterative working to the max! The most basic form of this is the Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL), which is a staple of languages like Python, Julia, R and F#. In the greater .NET ecosystem (which is pretty C# heavy) interactive programming hasn't been a thing, really. With the advent of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/interactive">.NET Interactive</a> this has begun to change. Jupyter Notebooks - interactive, web based, coding environments, that allow to mix prose, source code and formatted outputs - have been the defacto standard for communicating experiments within the Data Science and Machine Learning community for a while now but mostly for scripted languages and not really outside of the aforementioned niches.</p>
<p>With its latest push to make .NET a target for Machine Learning projects, Microsoft has shown great commitment to make all common .NET languages (Powershell, F# and C#) work well in Jupyter Notebooks. It even went a step beyond and started building great tooling for VSCode, that makes it possible to run and edit .NET interactive notebooks directly in the editor. Their <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-interactive-preview-3-vs-code-insiders-and-polyglot-notebooks/">latest blog post</a> - as of writing this - shows how to get started with .NET interactive in VSCode Insiders. I highly encourage you to try it out! While you're at it you can also check out the <a href="https://nteract.io/applications">nteract desktop application</a> which was one of the first apps I'm aware of, that allowed people to have a more integrated development experience while working with interactive notebooks.</p>
<p>All the sources I mention in this blog post can be found in <a href="https://github.com/WalternativE/WritingDotNetInteractiveFormatters">this repo</a> in case you might want to experiment with the code yourself.</p>
<p>A short disclaimer: please be aware, that everything connected to .NET Interactive is still pretty bleeding edge and therefore quite unstable. Nevertheless, right now is a good point in time to start using it cautiously and to provide feedback to the maintainers (or even fix some things yourself). If you find something in this post, that doesn't work for you anymore because of a change don't hesitate to reach out. I'll do my best to update it as soon as possible.</p>
<h2><a name="default-formatting">Default Formatting</a></h2>
<p>So when you write code, what do you usually do? I would guess that you write some functions, apply them to some values and get something back from those expressions. At least that's how it works for me. For a F# developer the things you get back are usually records, discriminated unions or Plain Old CLR Objects (POCOs). Because these types are so commonly used, .NET Interactive includes some sensible default formatting strategies. Let's look at a simple record:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Person =
    { Name: string
      Age: int }

let alice = { Name = &quot;Alice&quot;
              Age = 33 }

alice
</code></pre>
<p>If a value is returned without being bound to a name (or without being ignored) .NET Interactive will display it. We could also use the <code>display</code> function to get to the same output.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/writing-formatters-for-dotnet-interactive/simple_record_formatted.jpg" alt="The standard format of a simple record" /></p>
<p>This tabular view makes complete sense for records. It puts all the member names in the header and displays the values as a row. Even if you're not used to look at tabular data the whole day it is still understandable. So what about nested records? In the F# world we are pretty fond of composing more complicated data structures out of small and simple records. How would .NET Interactive handle the following?</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Car =
    { Make: string
      Owner: Person }

let alicesCar = { Make = &quot;Toyota&quot;; Owner = alice }

alicesCar
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/posts/writing-formatters-for-dotnet-interactive/nested_record_formatted.jpg" alt="The standard format of a nested record" /></p>
<p>Nice! Displaying nested tables would be odd, so .NET Interactive was so kind to display the nested record similar to how we constructed it in code. So what about POCOs? In F# it sometimes makes sense to define a plain old class or struct. How does .NET Interactive handle those kind of objects?</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Dog(name: string, isGoodBoy: bool) =
    member _.Name = name
    member _.IsGoodBoy = isGoodBoy

let henry = Dog(&quot;Henry&quot;, true)

henry
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/posts/writing-formatters-for-dotnet-interactive/simple_poco_formatted.jpg" alt="The standard format of a plain old clr object" /></p>
<p>This looks like the output for the record above, doesn't it? Well it does because it uses the same formatter. Records are just POCOs with a bit of compiler magic sprinkled on top. As we'll see with the next example of a nested POCO this extra compiler magic pays of in interactive programming environments (besides being great in general, of course).</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type DogHotel(name: string, inhabitants: Dog list) =
    member _.Name = name
    member _.Inhabitant = inhabitants

let hiltonForDogs = DogHotel(&quot;Hilton For Dogs&quot;, [ henry ])

hiltonForDogs
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/posts/writing-formatters-for-dotnet-interactive/nested_poco_formatted.jpg" alt="The standard format of a nested clr object" /></p>
<p>That doesn't look as nice, does it? Well it looks like this because .NET Interactive doesn't try to be extremely smart about displaying objects. It just goes through the top level properties, displays them in the table and basically calls <code>ToString</code> on the values in the row. This works well for F# records - because of the compiler magic - but not for POCOs. Let's look at Discriminated Unions next.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Fruit =
    | Orange
    | Banana
    | Apple

Apple
</code></pre>
<p>For simple case identifiers without any data .NET Interactive just displays the identifier name. In this case we will read <code>Apple</code>. How would that differ for more complicated union types?</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type GiftBasket =
    | EmptyBasket
    | FruitBasket of Fruits: Fruit list
    | SpoiledFruitBasket of Fruit list

let aNiceGiftBasket = FruitBasket [ Orange; Orange; Banana; Banana; Banana; Apple ]
let aNotVeryNiceGiftBasket = SpoiledFruitBasket [ Orange; Orange; Banana; Banana; Banana; Apple ]

display aNiceGiftBasket
display aNotVeryNiceGiftBasket
display [ aNiceGiftBasket; aNotVeryNiceGiftBasket ]
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/posts/writing-formatters-for-dotnet-interactive/du_withdata_formatted.jpg" alt="Different ways to format discriminated unions with data using the dotnet interactive standard formatter" /></p>
<p>There's a bit to unpack here. The first line displays the data of the nice gift basket which is a <code>FruitBasket</code>. We get the descriptive <code>Fruits</code> table header because that's the name we gave to the field. For the <code>SpoiledFruitBasket</code> we did not specify this field name, so we'll get the standard <code>Item</code> label. It seems a bit odd to me, that we don't get to see which case identifier we're currently looking at. It gets even more odd when we see that the standard formatter displays the case identifier types correctly for lists. I'm not entirely sure why that's the case but I'll use my confusion about this odd choice to show how to register custom formatters.</p>
<h2><a name="simple-plain-text-formatter">Simple Plain Text Formatter</a></h2>
<p>For me it should be super obvious whether I'm looking at <code>FruitBasket</code> or a <code>SpoiledFruitBasket</code>. So - only for this very special Discriminated Union - I'm going to register a formatter, that displays its standard F# string representation. .NET Interactive automatically loads all the libraries you need to extend it and exposes them globally for you. Let's take a look.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">module GiftBasketFormatter =
    Formatter.SetPreferredMimeTypeFor(typeof&lt;GiftBasket&gt; ,&quot;text/plain&quot;)

    Formatter.Register&lt;GiftBasket&gt;((fun basket writer -&gt;
        let formatted = sprintf &quot;%A&quot; basket
        writer.Write(formatted)), &quot;text/plain&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>We don't really need to create a module here but it makes sense to use one if you open up more namespaces and don't want to pollute your notebook scope with the extra <code>open</code> statements. We can access the <code>Formatter</code> class because .NET interactive loads a couple of assemblies in the background (as I mentioned before). We can use it to set the preferred MIME type for the type we wish to format. I think about it like I would about content type negotiation in a web context: .NET interactive gets the request to display a value, looks at its type, checks its default MIME type and selects the fitting formatter for the MIME type. You have to force its hand sometimes when a preexisting formatter would have the greater precedence, that's why I explicitly set the preferred MIME type.</p>
<p>Now that we specified, that <code>GiftBasket</code> values should be formatted as plaintext we can register a formatter. The <code>Register</code> method offers a bunch of different overloads. Currently - as of writing this - they aren't really documented so I basically roll with the ones, that work for my use cases and are convenient to use. The easiest version I've found so far is the one which takes an <code>Action&lt;'T, TextWriter&gt;</code> delegate where <code>'T</code> would be the type you want to format. In most cases we are totally fine by not explicitly creating the action delegate and defaulting to the much nicer F# lambda expression. I had problems with type inferences in some edge cases, though, so your mileage may vary 🤷‍♂️ Just remember, that you can always be more implicit in F# if you really need to and you'll be fine 👍</p>
<p>With the new formatter in place we can try out to display the different <code>GiftBasket</code> values again.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">display aNiceGiftBasket
display aNotVeryNiceGiftBasket
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/posts/writing-formatters-for-dotnet-interactive/du_withdata_formatted_custom.jpg" alt="Discriminated unions formatted with our custom formatter" /></p>
<p>Much better now! This example was - to be totally honest - not very useful, though. With the basics out of the way we can look at a more useful example.</p>
<h2><a name="charting-with-plotly-net">Charting with Plotly.NET</a></h2>
<p>On my search for a plotting library, that actually allows subplots (which <code>XPlot.Plotly</code> doesn't) I stumbled upon <code>Plotly.NET</code>. It started out (as many great science-y F# libraries) at the institute for <a href="https://github.com/CSBiology">Computational Systems Biology - CSB Kaiserslautern</a> but was moved to the <a href="https://github.com/plotly/Plotly.NET">official Plotly organization</a> some time ago. The current &quot;approved&quot; version is still in alpha but in general it feels much more mature than that.</p>
<p>I often use plots for looking at how the values within a dataset are distributed. Just to get a general feel, you know? Let's say we roll a &quot;random&quot; die in .NET and want to see how many ones and twos and threes and fours and sixes we have rolled. I'd usually go and look at a histogram for that. In <code>Plotly.NET</code>, that's pretty easy to do.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">open System
open Plotly.NET

let rollUniformDice (rnd: Random) =
    rnd.Next(1, 7)
    |&gt; int

let rnd = Random(Seed = 1)
let diceRolls = List.init 1000 (fun _ -&gt; rollUniformDice rnd)

diceRolls
|&gt; Chart.Histogram
</code></pre>
<p>If we would be using <code>XPlot.Plotly</code> we'd be looking at a nice histogram by now. That's the case because the .NET Interactive developers wrote a formatter for us. They obviously didn't do so for <code>Plotly.NET</code> and so we only get to see some object properties and nothing else. What a shame! Good, that we learned how to write a custom formatter. Of course, writing the HTML and JavaScript interpretation of a chart would be everything but trivial. We can thank the library authors, that they've already done this for us. To get the whole thing working I basically had to call a single method - that's it. At least it would be if there weren't a bug, that - as of writing this - breaks a piece of JavaScript in VSCode. It could be patched on the fly, though. Lucky us 🍀</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">module PlotlyFormatter =
    open System.Text
    open GenericChart

    Formatter.Register&lt;GenericChart&gt;((fun chart writer -&gt;
        let html = toChartHTML chart
        let hackedHtml =
            html.Replace(
                &quot;&quot;&quot;var fsharpPlotlyRequire = requirejs.config({context:'fsharp-plotly',paths:{plotly:'https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min'}})&quot;&quot;&quot;,
                &quot;&quot;&quot;var fsharpPlotlyRequire = requirejs.config({context:'fsharp-plotly',paths:{plotly:'https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min'}}) || require;&quot;&quot;&quot;
            )
        writer.Write(hackedHtml)), HtmlFormatter.MimeType)
</code></pre>
<p>When we try to display the same plotly chart from before we'll see a nice interactive histogram. Neat!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/writing-formatters-for-dotnet-interactive/plotly_output_with_formatter.jpg" alt="The output for a Plotly.NET chart with a custom formatter" /></p>
<p>Looking at such a histogram, it doesn't take me too long to recognize, that our &quot;dice rolls&quot; are uniformly distributed. This makes sense because the .NET standard random generator is - in fact - a generator for uniformly distributed numbers. With this knowledge (and a bit of internet research) we can even build our own normally distributed random generator. Validating if it works would take some math I don't really know too much about, so I'd just take the more intuitive route and look at the distribution in a histogram. If it looks like a bell-curve it's good enough for me.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let normalRandom (rnd: Random) =
    // mean of standardized normal distribution
    let mu = 0.
    // standard deviation of normalized standard distribution
    let sigma = 1.

    let u1 = 1. - rnd.NextDouble()
    let u2 = 1. - rnd.NextDouble()
    let rndStdNormal =
        Math.Sqrt(-2. * Math.Log(u1)) * Math.Sin(2. * Math.PI * u2)

    mu + sigma * rndStdNormal

let rnd = Random(Seed = 1)

List.init 10000 (fun _ -&gt; normalRandom rnd)
|&gt; Chart.Histogram
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/images/posts/writing-formatters-for-dotnet-interactive/plotly_normal_distribution.jpg" alt="A normal distribution plotted as a Plotly histogram" /></p>
<p>Looks good to me! Of course it is only an approximation because the used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform">Box-Muller Transform</a> isn't 100% exact but with large enough samples we can get really close to the ideal. The neat thing about interactive programming is, that we can just try to tweak the parameters, look at the resulting plots and iterate pretty quickly until we either try something completely different or are content with what we have.</p>
<p>So now, that we have a <code>Plotly.NET</code>, that works for us, how are we going to reuse it? We can just copy it from notebook to notebook (and I have done this a lot for this and other formatters) but that doesn't really scale, does it? The .NET Interactive team anticipated that and implemented an extension mechanism. Let's take a look at that next!</p>
<h2><a name="writing-an-extension-package">Writing an Extension Package</a></h2>
<p>Writing a kernel extension for .NET Interactive is pretty straight forward, it has a couple of catches, though. Especially now while the project is still on the bleeding edge of development. I've built one or two extensions in the last couple of weeks, so I can at least share what I've found out so far. In its core every kernel extension is just a plain old .NET library you can load as a NuGet package. Go and take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/WalternativE/WritingDotNetInteractiveFormatters/tree/main/Dotnet.Interactive.Extension.Plotly.Net">F# project</a> I created for the <code>Plotly.NET</code> extension. Tiny, isn't it? Just one source code file and a project file. If you take a look at the source code you'll basically see what we've already seen in the code cell - with one important addition.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">namespace Dotnet.Interactive.Extension.Plotly.Net

<p>Instead of a raw <code>Formatter.Register</code> call we define a type and implement the <code>IKernelExtension</code> interface which has one method <code>OnLoadAsync</code>. This method would take a <code>Kernel</code> object and return a <code>Task</code>. In my implementation I don't need the <code>Kernel</code>, so I discard it. Also, I don't have async operations in my code which allows me to just return a completed <code>Task</code>. Other than that I just check if I have a <code>KernelInvocationContext</code> - I don't know exactly when I wouldn't but I'm pretty sure, that if this can be <code>null</code> there are cases where it will be - register the formatter and print a message for the consumers of this extension, telling them what it does. That's it. No more work to do for us in this part of the project. As you might imagine, this wouldn't actually work without a little extra in the project file. Let's see.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/docs/extending-dotnet-interactive.md">official docs</a> on writing extensions have some pointers on how to get started. They don't really talk about the extra bits you need in your project file so I thought we should take the time and do it here. I'm still unsure about the <code>ItemGroup</code>, that excludes items from the <code>bin</code> directory. I assume, that this is mainly meant for generated assets that could get referenced in the package but as they are very consistent with this even in extension packages, that don't have any generated content I'd just play it save and leave it as is. It didn't make any difference in my tests, though, so there should be no harm in omitting this.</p>
<p>The second addition is far more important. Kernel extensions are only picked up by .NET Interactive if they are contained within the <code>interactive/extensions/dotnet</code> folder of your NuGet package. You really have to specify this exactly this way or it won't work - no way around that. That's it. That's all the things you need to make your .NET Interactive extension sharable. I personally think, that this is super awesome. I've already seen people using <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a> to embed React apps into interactive notebooks. With the power to transform any datatype into some web-digestible format the opportunities are virtually limitless.</p>
<p>Be aware, that as of now not all packages you'd need to build an extension are in the public NuGet.org repositories. They aren't private, though, so you can always try out the experimental bits produced by Microsoft. I took the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/NuGet.config">NuGet.config file</a> the .NET Interactive team is using internally and put it in the root of the solutions where I develop my kernel extensions which resolves all sorts of dependency issues. I'm pretty sure, that when the times come to officially release .NET interactive this step will become unnecessary.</p>
<h2><a name="a-shameless-plug-for-deedle">A Shameless Plug for Deedle</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://fslab.org/Deedle/">Deedle</a> is the most mature data frame implementation .NET currently has. Sure, there are others like <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/an-introduction-to-dataframe/">Microsoft's own data frame</a> or <a href="https://github.com/SciSharp/Pandas.NET">SciSharp's Pandas.NET</a> but neither of them are currently out of their respective alpha stages. Deedle might have quite the learning curve but with a bit of training (and maybe a couple of example notebooks - just putting it out there) one can get really productive with it. I've been using it for a while now in .NET Interactive for some experiments and I've been pretty happy with it. Of course I had to write a formatter for it, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/WalternativE/Deedle.DotNet.Interactive.Extension">here</a>. It is still pretty rough and before I can even think about getting it into the official Deedle repository I need <strong>your</strong> feedback. So if you are as enthusiastic about the future of interactive programming in .NET, do me a solid and take some time to play with it. I'd be really happy about some feedback, that could help me to make this formatter as good as it can be for Deedle users. Thanks in advance!</p>
